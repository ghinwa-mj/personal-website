He returned to Lebanon in 1993 to embark on a 12-year political career and advised many of Lebanon’s leading politicians. He was appointed minister of economy and trade and elected a member of Parliament in 2000. A prominent economist and politician, Fuleihan was tragically killed by the bomb blast that assassinated former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on February 14, 2005. This award was established by his friends in 2015 and is awarded to the graduating student with a BA in economics with the highest average over his/her period of study at AUB"
