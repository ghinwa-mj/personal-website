<p style="text-align: center;">
I avoided the pen and paper for so long <br/>
It was the only thing, which would bring you back  <br/>
And feeling your presence would be so wrong <br/>
And the illustration of the only thing I lack  <br/>
My pen missed and longed for my hand <br/>
And my paper was tired and white <br/>
But going back to the lost and familiar land  <br/>
I could not bear for my emotions to be so bright <br/>
<br/>
I’ve fought for my right to forget <br/>
To let go of memories that turned into nothing more <br/>
But closure and clarity, I just would not get <br/>
And my hands, oh my hands, they were so sore <br/>
<br/>
They were always longing for something <br/>
But my head was weary and only wanted to fight <br/>
But that something, even you could not bring <br/>
Because you were no longer associated with light <br/>
<br/>
Closure, clarity I’ve learned to let go  <br/>
Because freedom was too high a price to pay <br/>
And forgiveness. I probably won’t be able to do so  <br/>
But it gets better day-by-day <br/>
<br/>
And one sunshiny morning <br/>
Alone with my cup of tea <br/>
My pen and paper will start to sing <br/>
Because their poet has come back to be 
</p>
