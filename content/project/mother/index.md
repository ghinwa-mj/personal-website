_On Heroes_

<small>

<p style="text-align: center;"> As I was growing up </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> My favorite Super Hero was my Mother </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Actually, it was Blossom from powerpuff girls </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> But it should have been my mother </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Because  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> No one describes heroism better than </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The person who pretends she doesn’t want that last piece of cake </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Though she is starving </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And that cake looks so damn delicious </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And I know this feels like something you may have read off Facebook </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Maybe because I read it off Facebook myself </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Forgive me Mother but </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> It always baffles me how I can find the perfect poem </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> To talk about love </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> In all its different shapes and sizes </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Except when it comes to you  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> It baffles me how I can find the perfect words </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> In every situation </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> In every occasion </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> But no words I find are enough </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> When it comes to  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Describing how heroic you are, mother </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Describing how beautiful your smile is, mother </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Describing how you are the definition of a blessing, mother </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You smile is contagious </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> It overflows </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Every time I see you cry </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Because the world is too messed up </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Or because someone just died in the movie you were watching </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Or because you were watching the news and Lebanon is breaking your heart </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Or simply because you were coming to my room to talk to me and I just wasn’t in a good enough  mood </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Everytime I see you cry </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> I wish </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> More than anything </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> That I could be the hero that you are </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And chase that sadness away from you </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And ruin every little thing that makes you sad </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Your resilience is contagious </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> It overflows </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You grew up at a time where it took </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Risking your life to go from one town to another </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You grew up at a time where it took </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Risking your life in order to get your college degree </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Yet, you are not angry </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Not bitter </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You wake up everyday looking for the sunshine </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> In every ounce of darkness </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You wake up everyday as a form of praise </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Regarding a life filled with struggle </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Yet you still eloquently win the battle </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Against the darkness of the world </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Your love is contagious </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> It overflows </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Everytime I feel like my life is black and grey </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You are red  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> You are pink and you are radiant  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And every shiny color there is   </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Mother, I apologize for every single time </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> I was too blind to see </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> The cape you wear on your shoulder </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Every morning after you wake up at 6am </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> And the halo you wear on your head </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Every night after you spend the day </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Fighting for goodness </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Against evil </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Mother, I am sorry that every time they used to ask me </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Who my favorite super hero was </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> I was too blind to say it was my mother. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">  </p>
