_On Women & Revolutions_

<small>
<p style="text-align: center;"> 
Let the woman in you roar <br/>
Because for too long, she’s been silenced <br/>
Let the woman in you fight <br/>
Because they expected you to always be frightened <br/>
Let the woman in you scream <br/>
Because your country needs you to fight today <br/>
Let the woman in you glow <br/>
Because without you, this revolution is so grey <br/>
<br/>
Rise from the ashes because <br/>
For too long, too much has been taken from you <br/>
Rise from the ashes and see <br/>
This land is for me & for you too <br/>
Rise from the ashes and say <br/>
Unity, unity what a beautiful view <br/>
Rise from the ashes and see <br/>
Your hopes will never again be so few <br/>
<br/>
This revolution is female  <br/>
And our rightful future we will declare <br/>
This revolution is inclusive <br/>
For too long, they’ve made us question our own flair <br/>
This revolution is fearless <br/>
And our leadership, they will have to endure <br/>
This revolution is endless <br/>
That, my determination can assure <br/> 
</p>
