_On love & numbers_ 

<small>
<p style="text-align: center;"> 
7 can only be divided by 7 and by 1  <br/>
7 can only be controlled by 7 and by 1 <br/>
7 has a heart <br/>
7’s heart can only be touched by 7 and by 1 <br/>
Every number from 0 to 7 <br/>
And from 7 to infinity <br/>
Has a heart <br/>
Which can be touched <br/>
By a different one <br/>
I think we all know who 1 is <br/>
I have a 1 <br/>
You have a 1 <br/>
You probably don’t have a 1  <br/>
But you’re looking for a 1 <br/>
1 is the number that no matter  <br/>
How many numbers you add to the  <br/>
List of numbers you know,  <br/>
That 1 will always stand out <br/>
1 is the number that no matter how much <br/>
The distance increases between you and 1 <br/>
Something will always pull you back to that 1  <br/>
7 has dreams  <br/>
7 hopes to some day become as big as 77 <br/>
Or maybe one day increase exponentially  <br/>
To a number beyond the understanding of mathematical definitions <br/>
To infinity <br/>
But even 77  <br/>
Divided by 11 <br/>
Will go back to 7 <br/>
And 7 only needs 1  <br/>
And 7 only loves 1 <br/>
And although 7 can be divided by 1 <br/>
1 does not make 7 small or not whole <br/>
1 does not change 7 <br/>
But rather <br/>
1 allows 7 to remain 7 <br/>
But a better version of 7 <br/>
And in a world where being prime <br/>
Has become quite odd <br/>
