abstract: "The spillover potential of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) provides little insight on how they can be used as a local economic development tool. To overcome this gap, this casestudy of the Coega Industrial Development Zone in South Africa focuses on its impact on Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) because SMME development can contribute to achieving various socio-economic impacts. The qualitative research confirms that through simultaneous provision of access to opportunities, finance and technical and managerial knowledge, SEZs can act as a policy development tool to SMMEs, allowing them to overcome important constraints. This case study provides policy implications on how to harness the role of SEZs as a tool for SMME development."
