Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), defined by the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing
technologies and processes, continuous to revolutionize the way we live, work and do business as well
as disrupt industries. Conway has been keeping up with the trends to better comprehend how IR 4.0
changes the competitiveness of countries FDI in specific industries and how it impacts the future of
Free Zones.


1. A determinant of success and survival for companies in IR 4.0 is innovation. Thus, companies
are looking for locations where an innovative-friendly environment is set up. This impacts the
type of talent companies look for. Trends show that the necessity of cheap labour is becoming
less important, as high skilled talent is more in demand. Industry 4.0 also make clusters such
as Free Zones more attractive locations for companies. This is due to the vast knowledge base
in close geographical proximity, the existence of an agglomeration of companies and talent
and finally, the potential to provide a more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and
cooperation.

**Companies will locate in zones that are closely located to regions where highly skilled talent lives
or would want to live. Proximity to local academic institutions, partner companies or zones that
have partner programs with knowledge based institutions (e.g. for training) tend to be more
favourable for potential investors in a IR 4.0 world.** 

2. In a high-risk world and an era of continuous disruptions, business-friendly regulations and
environments can go a long way in managing the risks of innovation. This impact the way
companies view incentives. Financial incentives and tax-benefits will still be an important
aspect of business decisions, but companies will begin to prioritize locations where R&D
spending and investments to keep up with Industry 4.0 trends are supported.

**Companies will locate in zones where tax-cuts on R&D spending and credit support for training
and talent development s are offered.**

3. Corporate expansion is already different in IR 4.0. Business frameworks, even within
manufacturing companies, are shifting from “product to service mindset”. This results in a
“Product Service System” concept, where product-service bundles are offered as solutions for
customers. The concept relies on suppliers, customers and other partners becoming part of a
networked and interrelated ecosystem. As a result, companies are less inclined to undertake a
greenfield investment purely based on costs, while the integration in the local value chain is
minimal.

**Companies will locate in zones where the ability to build strategic partnerships, collaboration
agreements for technology developments and supportive networks are available.**

4. Industry 4.0 will change the way we work. The common fear is that machines will be used to
replace workers, but many economists project that in fact, machines can be used to better
equip and support teams rather than replace them. It is nonetheless clear that Industry 4.0
presents opportunities to change the nature of work in organizations. The use of technology in
the workplace will foster greater collaboration and create more innovative, insightful and
creative roles for the future. It remains clear that one of the key advantages that humans will
always have over machines is empathy and creativity. Technological change makes this even
more relevant and not less.

**Companies will in free zones that provide collaborative work spaces that are good for innovation
and creativity and support the trend of how the nature of work and the requirements of the
workplace are changing.**

5. IR 4.0 will be the main determinant of which sectors remain relevant in the future. In 2018,
the World Economic Forum (WEF) projected strong employment growth in sectors such as
AI, robotics and blockchain, as well as non-tech positions such as customer service, training
and skills development, sales and marketing. Certain industries will grow, others will become
irrelevant and new ones will emerge. Companies within different industries evaluate different
criteria while internationally expanding. 

**Services provided by Free Zones must be adapted and uniquely tailored to the industries of the future.**

IR 4.0 is a development that creates both challenges and opportunities for free zones. Those zones that
are able to adapt and make the changes necessary will be most successful and reap the benefits of IR
4.0.
